# Disease-detection 
This project is able to do two things, first of all, it consists of Disease Detection by entering symptoms and also skin disease detection via images.

# Disease detection via symptoms 

This part of the project will take input in the form of symptoms the user is experiencing. when the code is run the user will be prompted 
"Enter your symptoms (or 'exit' to quit)", after this when the user enters the system he/she is experiencing the model will then compare the entered 
symptoms with the data providing the input as the disease the user has.

# Skin disease detection 

This part of the project will take input in the form of images through a camera, when the code runs the camera will switch on and capture the image in
front of it, this process will take 5 seconds which can be changed in the code. The trained model will then process the captured image using the TensorFlow 
library, according to this an output will be provided along with a confidence score telling which skin disease the user has. 

# NOTE

All the databases attached here are picked up from websites online and haven't been formed personally by me.

Also for disease detection via symptoms the database attached needs to be downloaded and then the path and column headings for the same replaced in the code
as mentioned in the code itself.
